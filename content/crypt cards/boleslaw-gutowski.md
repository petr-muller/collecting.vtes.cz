[Boleslaw Gutowski](https://vdb.im/cards/201528) is a special promo released in 2020 to celebrate the Polish language release of Vampire: the Masquerade.

## Indicators
- **Clan symbol**: V5 Malkavian (upright mirror)
- **Set icon**: Black Chantry Window
- **Copyright year**: 2020
- **Copyright entity**: Paradox Interactive AB (publ)
- **Miscellaneous indicators:** None

## Notes
- I am surprised that the card has standard Black Chantry set icon: most modern promo cards do not have any set icon
- No known variants
- The image from Black Chantry Promo Card has a filename containing "updated-copyright", suggesting there are variants (maybe just digital assets) with somehow different copyright.
